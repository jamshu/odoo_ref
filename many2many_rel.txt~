For a many2many field, a list of tuples is expected. Here is the list of tuple that are accepted, with the corresponding semantics

(0, 0,  { values }) link to a new record that needs to be created with the given values dictionary

(1, ID, { values }) update the linked record with id = ID (write values on it)

(2, ID) remove and delete the linked record with id = ID (calls unlink on ID, that will delete the object completely, and the link to it as well)

(3, ID) cut the link to the linked record with id = ID (delete the relationship between the two objects but does not delete the target object itself)

(4, ID) link to existing record with id = ID (adds a relationship)

(5) unlink all (like using (3,ID) for all linked records)

(6, 0, [IDs]) replace the list of linked IDs (like using (5) then (4,ID) for each ID in the list of IDs)

eg 
many2many ex
self.partner_ids = [[6, False,partner_ids]]
whre partner_ids is a list 
partner_ids = [89,98]

'od_checklist_ids': [[0, False, {'name': 'Check All modules are online'}],
                      [0, False, {'name': 'Check logs for HW errors'}],
                      [0,
                       False,
                       {'name': 'Check the health (FAN, Modules & Power supplies)'}],
                      [0,
                       False,
                       {'name': "For Modular devices, Check the CPU's Status (One CPUs should be master & One CPUs should be backup)"}]],
